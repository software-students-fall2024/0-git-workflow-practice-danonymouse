[Quantum Computer's Impact on Encryption](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-encryption/)


I took a course on quantum computing last semester - sparking my interest in 
quantum computers. The article explores how quantum computing poses a REAL threat to encryption 
standards status quo...explaining how it has the potential to break cryptographic protocols that are widely used today. Few examples are RSA, ECC, etc. The potential changes to our cybersecurity landscape could be revolutionary and it is truly exciting to think about how 
advancements like these may reshape digital security in the near (or FAR) future.

**Angela's Comment:** 
The article really underscores how quantum computing could disrupt our current encryption frameworks like RSA and ECC. It's a bit mind-blowing to think about how these advancements could completely redefine our cybersecurity landscape, making what's secure today potentially vulnerable tomorrow. It definitely sparks a lot of ideas about the future of digital security, whether that's near or way off in the future. One question I have is: how can we protect ourselves from these advancements? Is there a way to mitigate the risk of quantum computers being used to break encryption standards?
